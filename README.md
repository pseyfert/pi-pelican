# pi-pelican
a pelican theme to blend into the webpages of the physics institute at heidelberg university

# issues

 * this certainly does not profit from the central php header and footer file and excludes virtually all the features shipped along
 * i don't ship the university's css files
 * the license disclaimer and pointer to the template sources (required by the AGPL 3 license from the original 'simple' theme of pelican) is not super pretty.
